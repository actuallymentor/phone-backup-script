# phone-backup-script

This is a backup script I use to pull important data from my phone before flashing it with a clean ROM.

I chose not to use Titanium Backup to place back all my apps but rather to cleanly install and configure as many apps as possible.

This script assumes:

- you are on Mac OS X
- have adb installed
- have usb debugging enabled on your phone or are in recovery mode

This is a very specific script to my phone. You will probably not be able to use it one on one with your phone, but could draw some inspiration from it.
